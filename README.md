### 💾 Data Persistence

ProductivityHub uses `localStorage` to save your tasks and projects. This means your data is stored locally on your computer and will be available even after you close and reopen the app.

#### Saving Data

Every time you create or update a project or task, the data is automatically saved to `localStorage`.

#### Loading Data

When you open the app, it will automatically load any saved data from `localStorage`.

### 💡 Tips

- **Inspect Data**: Use DevTools to inspect your `localStorage` data. Open the Application tab in DevTools and click on the Local Storage tab under Storage.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure your app doesn't crash if there's no data in `localStorage`.
